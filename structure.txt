FILLIT PROGRAM STRUCTURE
---					 ---

• MAIN()
	Starting input point for the program.
	Calls parser() to return list of pieces (& determine if valid file).
	Calls solver() to solve puzzle.
	Calls map_printer() to print solved puzzle.
	Calls free_map() to free map.
	Calls free_pieces() to free piece list.

	Input:	arguments from stdin
	Output:	-

	• PARSER()
		Calls open() on filestring to get an fd.
		Calls piecemaker() in a loop to read through file and return pieces.
		Appends each new piece to the piece list.
		Closes fd.
		Returns error if invalid file.
			
		Input:	filename as a string
		Output:	t_list pointer to head of piece list

		• PIECEMAKER()
			Reads through a given section of the buffer to create a t_piece struct.
			Uses size limits and calls valid_checker() as it reads to check if valid file.

			Input:	char * beginning of piece, char * end of piece
			Output:	t_piece pointer to new piece

			• VALID_CHECKER()
				Checks if the file is valid.
				A file is invalid if ([x] indicates already checked in parser):
					[x] Fewer than 21 bytes
					- 	Piece chunk does not contain 4 '#' characters
					- 	adjacency_counter() return isn't 6 or 8
					- 	Lines are more than 4 chars long (excluding '\n')
					- 	Piece blocks are more than 4 lines long
					- 	Contains chars other than '.', '#', and '\n'
					- 	Contains invalid pieces
					[x] Greater than 544 bytes

					• ADJACENCY_COUNTER()
						Checks if piece has a valid number of adjacencies.
						Valid tetrominos will contain either 6 or 8 (8 if little square) adjacencies.
		
	• SOLVER()
		Calls mapper() to create a blank map.
		Calls fitter() in a loop to start recursive backtracking implementation.
		While fitter() fails, increments size of blank map.
		Returns solved mapp when fitter() succeeds.

		Input: piece list head (t_list pointer)
		Output: solved map as a 2-D array

		• FITTER()
			>> RECURSIVE BACKTRACKING TIME! <<
			While the piece doesn't hit either edge, call placer() to add the piece to the map.
			If placer() is unsuccessful, move piece 1 space forward within map.
			If placer() is successful, call fitter() on the next piece
			If placer() is unusscessful for ALL placements of next piece, backtrack to previous piece, & move 1 space forward.
			Repeat until valid map is found.
			Return solved map.

			• PLACER()
				 Checks if current position of piece is valid (no intersections with other pieces).
				 If not, return (0).
				 If yes, places piece, calls letterer() to replace '#' characters with letter corresponding to piece number.
					-- keep track of how many pieces, as letterer() must fill with a different letter for each!

				 Input: Tetris piece struct pointer, map pointer, x coordinate, y coordinate.
				 Output: Integer (success or failure flag)

				• LETTERER()
					Replaces given tetromino's '#' characters with the given letter.

					Input: Tetris piece struct pointer, character
					Output: Tetris piece struct pointer

• MAP_PRINTER()
	Prints solved map.

• FREE_MAP()
	Frees malloc'd 2D map array.

• FREE_PIECES()
	Frees malloc'd list of pieces.
