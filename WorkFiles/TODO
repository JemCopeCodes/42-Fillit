CLEANUP
	close file descriptor in parser()
	put correctly formatted explanation comments above each function
	
MAKEFILE
	Makefile must compile without relinks -- does it?
	Do we want to take out the debug rule?

FILE STRUCTURE
	Executable must be in root directory (are we planning on that being ProjectFiles?)
	All sources and headers must be in the same folder.
	We can have two folders, one for libft and one for fillit.

PROGRAM FUNCTION
	Unclear from PDF if we should accept files that don't have a \n at the end -- ask peers.
	Unclear what the time limit for running is -- ask peers.
